# The SPARKS Foundation DSBA Repository(September, 2020 - October, 2020)
This repo is for storing code and documents of the user [Sandip Dutta](https://github.com/Dutta-SD) related to internship at The SPARKS Foundation.
During the internship, the following tasks were performed:
## Data Science Mentor (October - December, 2020)
 * Cleared doubts pertaining to tasks by fellow interns
 * Received Letter of Recommendation for exceptional work

<!--  Data Science Intern-->
## Data Science Intern (September 2020)

* **Business Analytics (TASK - 4)** - In this *final task*,  we were to analyse a business data. 
  * Data was analysed using `pandas`. 
  * EDA was performed using `Seaborn` and `Matplotlib`. 
  * Applied Hypothesis tests like `chi2_contingency` and `kendalltau` using `scipy.stats`. 
  * Fitted a `RidgeRegression` model from sklearn
  * The final accuracy came to about 0.995.
  
* **Decision Tree (TASK - 3)** - In this task we were to explore **Decision Tree Algorithm** using sklearn on IRIS dataset. 
  * Splitted the data into train and validation part. 
  * Fitted a `DecisionTreeClassifier` on the dataset. 
  * For visulaising it, we used matplotlib. 
  * Then we plotted decision surfaces for two features and checked the accuracy of the model. 
  * Decision tree gave a good f1-score(near to 1.00).
  
* **Iris_Unsupervised (TASK - 2)** - This folder is for the iris data analysis using **KMeans and DBSCAN algorithm**. 
  * First plots were generated and features visualised. 
  * Then DBSCAN was applied and we got the optimum number of clusters as 3. 
  * We shifted to K Means(after scaling the data). 
  * We determined the ideal number of clusters using elbow method and it too came out to be 3. 
  * Lastly, we plotted a confusion matrix to see the classification.
  
* **Student_data (TASK - 1)** - This folder contains data for some students. 
  * Task is to predict whether score increases if number of hours of study increases. 
  * We performed EDA and fitted a linear Regression model for this data. 
  * The accuracy came to be about 95 % based on `r2_score` metric.
