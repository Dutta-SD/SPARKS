1. **Student_data (TASK - 1)** - This folder contains data for some students. Task is to predict whether score increases if number of hours of study increases. We performed EDA and fitted a linear Regression model for this data. The accuracy came to be about 95 % based on r2 score metric.
2. **iris_Unsupervised (TASK - 2)** - This folder is for the iris data analysis using KMeans and DBSCAN algorithm. First plots were generated and features visualised. Then DBSCAN was applied and we got the optimum number of clusters as 3. Then we shifted to K Means(after scaling the data). We determined the ideal number of clusters using elbow method and it too came out to be 3. Lastly, we plotted a confusion matrix to see the classification.
